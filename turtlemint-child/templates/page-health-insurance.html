<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">What is a health insurance policy?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health insurance, also called Mediclaim, is a way to pay for advanced medical treatments that typically require you to be in hospital overnight. It also covers certain other day care procedures like cataract surgery, etc. that don't require you to be hospitalized but are expensive nevertheless. A health insurance policy, therefore, covers your medical expenses and gives you financial relief.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center","level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Why is health insurance policy important &amp; why should you buy it?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical insurance is a form of insurance which covers the medical costs incurred in case of medical emergencies. These plans, thus, take care of the financial burden associated with medical contingencies. In today’s age, when illnesses and diseases are on the rise, a health insurance plan becomes necessary. Though medical developments have provided a cure for most of the illnesses, such as cures and treatments come at very expensive costs. These costs become unbearable for the common middle-class man. A health plan, by covering these costs, takes off the financial strain caused by frequently occurring illnesses. It, therefore, proves to be an essential requirement for every individual looking to secure his finances against medical contingencies.<br></p>

<li><strong>Check For The Insured Sum</strong><br>Many companies limit the amount that you can invest in a policy. If you wish to invest a higher sum, look for insurance that suits your requirements.

Hence, before making any investment be sure that you have read and completely understood the guidelines. Be very sure regarding how much cost would be covered by your insurance per hospitalization.And what are the pre and post limits of the plan as well. Some companies provide 30 day pre and 60 day post hospitalization costs while some companies provide 60 and 90 days period.<br>Certain exclusions are included in each and every plan. Make sure you read through them carefully. Check for the waiting periods and co-pay. Shorter waiting period and voluntary co-paying is ideal.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Don’t forget Additional Benefits</strong><br>Most health insurance companies offer additional benefits with the policies to hold themselves up in the competitive market.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Benefits of health insurance plans &amp; policies</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medical insurance policies offer various advantages and come with unique features which are as follows –</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Medical insurance plans cover all medical costs incurred right from the time the insured falls sick to his hospitalisation and also after being discharged from the hospital. Thus, the plan has a wide scope of coverage for medical costs</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>There are value-added coverage benefits in medical insurance policies too. These include free health check-ups after a specified period, second medical opinion for serious illnesses, etc.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Health plans allow tax advantages. Premiums paid for medical insurance policies for self, family and dependent parents qualify for tax deduction under Section 80D. The limit of deduction if INR 25, 000 for covering self and family and another INR 25, 000 for covering dependent parents. Moreover, if either the policyholder and/or dependent parents are senior citizens, the maximum limit increases to INR 50, 000 in each instance. Thus, a maximum of INR 1 lakh can be claimed as tax deduction though health insurance plans</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>No Claim bonus is allowed in all medical insurance plans if no claim is made in a policy year. This bonus is either allowed as an increase in the sum insured or additional benefits can be availed like gift vouchers, annual health check-ups, etc.&nbsp;</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">Does my existing health insurance policy include coronavirus (COVID-19) treatment?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, your existing plans of health insurance in India would cover Coronavirus treatments if you are hospitalised.

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">Factors to consider while deciding the health insurance company and its plan</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"tm-link underlined"} -->
<p class="tm-link underlined">Since medical insurance plans are important in providing financial security, they are quite popular. Almost all general insurance companies in India offer a wide variety of health insurance plans for individuals. Among the hundreds of plans available, it becomes very difficult for individuals to understand which plan would be the best health plan for them. So, here is a guide to choose the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.turtlemint.com/health-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best health insurance</a>&nbsp;in India –</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Understand the type of coverage required first and foremost, individuals should understand the type of health plan which would suit their needs. If they don’t have any health insurance, a family floater or individual plan is recommended. If there is an existing health plan, a top-up plan is good for enhancing coverage at low health insurance quotes. Critical illness plans are also a must for protection against major illnesses while disease-specific plans are helpful in protecting against specified ailments. Individuals should assess their requirement and choose the most suitable plans for themselves.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensure that all family members are covered health contingencies can strike anyone and so individuals should endeavour to cover all of their family members under health insurance plans.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The sum insured should be optimal the sum insured of the medical insurance plan should be sufficient to pay for the high medical costs which would incur in an emergency.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Look for comprehensive coverage features the medical insurance plan which provides the most inclusive coverage benefits would be the best health plan. Individuals should look for such comprehensive plans and see if the coverage benefits are relevant to their needs.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The premium rate should be reasonable besides the coverage benefits which should be all-inclusive, the premium of the best health insurance plan should also be reasonable and affordable. If the plan has very high premiums, it would not be the best health insurance plan.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Compare before buying to choose the best health insurance plan in India, the best way is to compare the different plans and then buy one. Comparing lets you see the available plans and helps you in choosing one plan which is the best from the rest.<br></li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the factors that affect health insurance premiums?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"tm-link underlined"} -->
<p class="tm-link underlined">There are certain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.turtlemint.com/health-insurance/articles/how-is-the-premium-for-health-insurance-calculated/">major factors</a>&nbsp;that affect the type of coverage you will receive on your insurance. Some of the most important of them are as follows-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Age</strong><br>The general rule of thumb is, higher the age, higher the premium. It is because older people are more likely to suffer and claim the insurance than young people who are in the pink of their health.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Past Medical History</strong><br>It highly affects the amount of premium you are going to pay. If you have a pre-medical condition, then the premium charged is higher. However if you are relatively healthy, the premium is less.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Occupation</strong><br>Your occupation highly influences your premium rates. For example, if you are a corporate employee or a teacher, the premium would be less, however, if you work at a construction site or factory, premiums are generally high. This happened due to the degree of risk factor that is involved with both kinds of task.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong><br>People with a higher BMI are prone to more ailments like heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, breathing problems, high blood pressure and cancer than people with lower body mass index. Hence the premium is higher for the people with more BMI.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Smoking habits</strong><br>Insurance companies view smokers as high-risk insurance buyers since they are more inclined towards health risks. Therefore, smokers are charged more premium in comparison to non-smokers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Geographical Location</strong><br>The location where you stay affects your premium cost since certain regions lack proper healthy food options, climate and health facilities.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Policy Duration</strong><br>If you choose a longer term plan, the premium would be less that is why investing earlier in health insurance is always suggested.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Co-insurance feature</strong><br>If you choose the co-insurance feature of the company while purchasing the policy, your premiums reduce to a great extent.<br></li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some myths about health insurance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to health insurance, there are still many who are not very well versed with its components. Due to lack of information, often myths can arise. Here are some of the most common myths regarding health insurance and its coverage-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth:&nbsp;&nbsp; I am young and fit. I don't need health insurance.<br>Reality&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the best time to invest in a health policy while you are young and fit. Companies will charge you a lower percentage of premium and you will receive a greater amount of coverage over a long period of time.<br>Certain diseases do not show early symptoms and by the time they become critical and evident, it becomes too late to invest in a policy and avail the benefits because pre-existing health conditions come with a waiting period of 36 to 48 months generally from the day of buying the policy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth:&nbsp;&nbsp; 24-hour hospitalisation is mandatory for making a claim<br>Reality&nbsp;No, it's not. With the rapid improvement in medical technology, certain surgeries/ daycare procedures get completed within 24 hours and do not require hospitalisation. Such coverage is offered by most companies, yet make sure your policy contains all such benefits.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth:&nbsp;&nbsp; My health insurance policy will cover 100% of my hospital bills<br>Reality&nbsp;Every policy has different caps and limits when it comes to claim settlement. Hence, a certain amount of the entire expense is usually provided by the insurance companies at every claim settlement. There are certain exclusions in every policy, these uncovered expenses are to be borne by the policyholder.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth:&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have to disclose all my medical details.<br>Reality&nbsp;Disclosing all the medical details to the insurer is required in order to confirm that your medical condition falls under the coverage terms of the company. It is also necessary to give proof of expense for making claims. Hiding information can lead to rejection of claims and even legal trouble.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth:&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have a health issue, I will not be able to buy health insurance.<br>Reality&nbsp;You can buy special health insurance if you have pre-existing conditions. There are certain health insurance products specially made for people who have some medical issues. However, the effect of your health condition will directly affect the premium to be paid.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; A health plan does not cover maternity benefits.<br>Reality&nbsp;Not all health plans cover maternity benefits, so be sure to check the same while investing in a policy. However, most insurances offer that add-on and maternity benefits can be enjoyed only after the completion of the waiting period. There are companies that have especially made health insurance products for women.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Myth<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Buying health insurance through an agent is the best way to buy.<br>Reality&nbsp;Nowadays, with so much information available online, it is best to invest in health insurance after proper comparison with all the other companies. You can use the premium calculators to find policies online and compare. Buying health insurance online will not only save you time and effort, but can also help you get a good deal.<br></li>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
