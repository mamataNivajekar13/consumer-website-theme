<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In India, the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 governs the traffic rules which every vehicle has to follow if it is to run on Indian roads. One such rule specified in the Motor Vehicles Act is the requirement of a valid third party insurance cover on every vehicle, whether private or commercial, which runs on Indian roads. As such, if you are a vehicle owner, you need to buy a vehicle insurance policy on your vehicle to comply with the insurance rules contained in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">What is two-wheeler insurance?</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Add-ons under bike insurance plans</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"tm-link underlined"} -->
<p class="tm-link underlined">Under comprehensive bike insurance plans, there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.turtlemint.com/two-wheeler-insurance/articles/know-two-wheeler-insurance-plans-add-ons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different types of add-ons</a>&nbsp;which are available. These add-ons are additional coverage benefits which can be selected voluntarily by the policyholder by paying an additional premium. Some of the most popular and common add-ons found in bike insurance plans are as follows â€“</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Zero depreciation add-on<br>Bikes undergo depreciation as they are used and they age. This depreciation is not covered under bike insurance plans. When a claim occurs, the insurance company deducts the relevant depreciation on different parts of the bike before paying the claim. However, in repairs, you incur the actual cost of the parts being repaired. When the depreciation is deducted, you get a lower claim amount and face out-of-pocket expenses. A zero depreciation add-on, therefore, proves useful. Under this add-on, the depreciation on the parts of the bike is not considered at the time of claim. The insurance company pays the actual costs of repairs irrespective of the depreciation suffered. Thus, your out-of-pocket expenses are reduced.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Roadside assistance add-on<br>If your bike faces a breakdown in the middle of the road and it cannot be taken to the nearest garage, a roadside assistance add-on proves useful. This add-on provides you 24*7 support in case of breakdowns. You just have to inform the insurance company and the company sends assistance wherever you are. Assistance is provided for flat tyres, loss of fuel, electrical breakdowns, jump-starting the bike, etc.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>NCB protect add-on<br>In a bike insurance policy, if you do not make any claim in a policy year, you earn a no claim bonus. This bonus allows you a discount on the renewal premium. Moreover, the bonus increases after every subsequent claim-free year. However, when a claim occurs, the entire no claim bonus is lost. This add-on protects this loss of no claim bonus. It keeps the NCB intact even after you make a claim on your bike insurance policy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Lost key replacement<br>If you lose the keys of your bike, this add-on would cover the cost of replacing the lost key with a new one.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Medical expenses add-on<br>Under this add-on, the medical expenses which you face if you are hospitalised following a bike accident are covered.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Personal accident cover for the pillion rider<br>A bike insurance policy mandates a personal accident cover only for the owner/driver of the bike. The cover is not available for the pillion rider. However, with this add-on, a personal accident cover can also be taken for the pillion rider.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Consumables cover<br>In case of repairs of the bike, the costs incurred on consumables are not covered under the bike insurance policy. These consumables include engine oil, nuts, bolts, screws, lubricants, etc. which are used by the garage in repairing the bike. However, the consumables cover add-ons ensures that the cost of consumables is also covered by the bike insurance policy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Return to invoice<br>When the bike is damaged beyond repairs or if it is stolen, the bike insurance policy pays the Insured Declared Value of the bike which is the market value of the bike after depreciation. However, if this add-on is selected, the claim paid would be equal to the invoice value of the bike.<br></li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Why should you buy comprehensive two-wheeler insurance?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comprehensive two-wheeler insurance is an all-in-one policy that offers full coverage against any damages caused to you, your bike, or a third party. A comprehensive plan covers third-party liabilities in case you hurt them or damage their property. Apart from this, you get covered against fire, theft, natural disasters, or any such incidents. With a comprehensive plan, you also get covered in case of a medical emergency caused due to accidents.<br><br>Though a comprehensive two-wheeler insurance plan includes a lot of benefits, you can add extra features to your plan by choosing relevant add-on covers. Zero depreciation cover, emergency roadside assistance, no claim bonus protection, and engine protection are some of the popular add-on covers available under a bike insurance policy. One should consider buying comprehensive two-wheeler insurance over a basic third-party liability plan as it gives you the extended protection required for your bike. Although the cost of a comprehensive plan is a bit higher than that of a third-party liability plan, it proves to be worth it when anything goes wrong.<br></p>
